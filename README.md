# SQL and No-SQL databases
## Course - I590 taught at Indiana University Bloomington

The I590 course incorporates designing, querying and performing data analysis using SQL as well as NoSQL solutions. This repository contains my work during this course in the form of assignments and projects.

Assignments:
1. [Relational Algebra](../master/Assignment1/sql_assignment1.pdf) - This assignment focuses on using relational algebra to query a relational database.
2. [MySQL query example](../master/Assignment2/q10.PNG) - This assignment requires nested SQL queries to fetch required data from a structured database.
3. [Visualization example](../master/Assignment3/Sheet1.png) - This assignment uses a MongoDB collection containing forest fire data. The goal is to generate data vizualizations in <b>Tableau</b> after querying data using the Mongo shell.
4. [Xquery](../master/Assignment4/XML%20Example/XQueryProject/xquery3.xquery) - Xquery assignment to query data from .xml files.
5. Neo4J assigment to build and query a graph database consisting of data collected to detect fradulent transactions.

<b>Project:</b>
The course project consisted of getting data from the Kickstarter platform, loading it into MongoDB and then analyzing the data using PyMongo in a [Jupyter Notebook](../master/Project/Kickstarter%20Data%20Analysis%20using%20PyMongo.ipynb)
